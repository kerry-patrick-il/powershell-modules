# powershell-modules

a set of useful modules to include in my powershell profile locally

## New-Jest

Runs several node commands to spin up a new jest-based testing environment in the current directory. Useful for doing TypeScript or JavaScript code kata. Also documents what I need to do to install Jest into an existing project.

**Assumptions**

- current directory has not already been 'npm init'ed
- current directory is where you want your package.json and config files to live
- npm is installed
- VS code is installed
- internet access

## TODO

- create Powershell install script for loading these modules locally
